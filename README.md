# line-roughness
calculate the roughness of one dimensional curve

One-Dimensional Roughness Parameters
Standardized one-dimensional roughness parameters can be evaluated with the Roughness tool.

The one-dimensional texture is split into waviness (the low-frequency components defining the overall shape) and roughness (the high-frequency components) at the cut-off frequency. This frequency is specified in the units of the Nyquist frequency, that is value 1.0 corresponds to the Nyquist frequency. It is also displayed as the corresponding real-space wavelength.

In the following formulas we assume the mean value of rj is zero, i.e. it holds
